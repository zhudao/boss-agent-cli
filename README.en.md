## 💡 Why boss-agent-cli?

Traditional job hunting: open a web page → flip through dozens of pages → check each detail → organize shortlists manually → forget who to follow up with.

With AI Agents: `boss search` -> `boss detail` -> `boss shortlist` -> `boss stats` — one local-assist chain for organizing work while sensitive actions stay on the official website.

Every command outputs **structured JSON** that AI Agents parse directly. Default low-risk mode blocks automated outreach, bulk actions, contact exchange, recruiter candidate data workflows, and risk-control retries.

## ⚠️ Compliance Boundary

The project enables Low-Risk Assistance Mode by default. It is intentionally scoped to local assistance, read-only-first workflows, and user-triggered actions. CLI commands that would greet, batch-greet, apply, exchange contacts, search recruiter candidates, read candidate resumes/chats, request attachments, or reply to candidates are blocked by default; users should perform those actions manually on the official platform.

## 🌟 Core Capabilities

### Job-seeker workflow

- **Discovery**: keyword search, layered filters, and cached `show` navigation. Commands: `search` `show`
- **Welfare-aware search**: `--welfare "双休,五险一金"` runs real AND matching by paging, fetching details, and checking text fallback. Command: `search --welfare`
- **Local shortlist**: inspect details and organize candidate jobs locally; apply and messaging stay on the official website. Commands: `detail` `show` `shortlist`
- **Pipeline control**: local shortlist and funnel stats from local state. Commands: `shortlist` `stats`
- **Conversation support**: low-risk local organization only by default; message history, labels, and contact exchange are sensitive workflows and blocked by default.
- **AI job-hunting assist**: JD analysis, resume polish, role-targeted optimization, interview prep, and chat coaching. Commands: `ai analyze-jd` `ai polish` `ai optimize` `ai interview-prep` `ai chat-coach`

### Recruiter workflow

- **Recruiter boundary**: candidate search, applications, resumes, chat records, attachment requests, contact exchange, and replies are blocked by default; use the official recruiter UI for those actions.
- **Job lifecycle management**: list, bring online, and take offline recruiter postings. Commands: `hr jobs list` `hr jobs online` `hr jobs offline`

### Platform & integration foundation

- **Schema-first integration**: `boss schema` is the capability source of truth for shell agents, SDKs, and tool-export formats
- **Structured transport**: stdout is JSON-only, stderr is logs-only, which keeps automation stable
- **Platform-aware login**: user-triggered login state is stored locally and encrypted; it is not a risk-control bypass workflow
- **Cross-platform adapter layer**: `Platform` / `RecruiterPlatform` registries are live, with low-risk mode governing sensitive capabilities
- **MCP server with 32 tools**: exposes only the low-risk tool surface by default

## 📦 Install

```bash
# Recommended: install via uv (fast, isolated)
uv tool install boss-agent-cli
patchright install chromium

# Or pipx
pipx install boss-agent-cli
patchright install chromium

# From source
git clone https://github.com/can4hou6joeng4/boss-agent-cli.git
cd boss-agent-cli && uv sync --all-extras
uv run patchright install chromium
```

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Environment check
boss doctor

# 2. Login (automatic 4-tier fallback)
boss login

# 3. Verify login
boss status

# 4. Search Golang jobs in Guangzhou with 双休 + 五险一金
boss search "Golang" --city 广州 --welfare "双休,五险一金"

# 5. View detail → add to local shortlist
boss show 1
boss shortlist add <security_id> <job_id>

# 6. AI-powered chat reply
boss ai reply "请问什么时候方便聊一下？"

# 7. Investment funnel analysis
boss stats --days 30

# 8. Recruiter mode
boss hr jobs list                       # my job postings
# Candidate search, resumes, chat, replies, attachments, and contact exchange are blocked by default.
```

## 🎭 Roles & Platforms

boss-agent-cli covers both the job-seeker and the recruiter side, with a pluggable platform layer for future adapters and explicitly unsupported placeholders.

| Role | Flag | Entry commands |
|------|------|----------------|
| Candidate *(default)* | `--role candidate` | `search` / `detail` / `shortlist` |
| Recruiter | `--role recruiter`, or `boss hr <sub>` shortcut | `hr jobs list`; candidate-data workflows are blocked by default |

| Platform | Candidate | Recruiter | Status |
|----------|:---------:|:---------:|--------|
| BOSS Zhipin (`zhipin`) | ✅ | ✅ | default |
| Zhaopin (`zhilian`)    | 🟡 candidate-side login + read/write flow wired | — | recruiter side is still intentionally unavailable at runtime |
| 51job (`qiancheng`)     | 🚧 registered placeholder | — | returns `NOT_SUPPORTED` until the read-only research gate is satisfied |

```bash
# pick a platform
boss --platform zhilian search "Python"
boss config set platform zhilian
# 51job is currently identity-only; real commands return NOT_SUPPORTED
boss --platform qiancheng status
```

Notes:
- `boss login` follows the current platform selection
- `boss --platform zhilian login` is available for candidate-side auth
- candidate-side `search / detail / user_info` are wired for `zhilian`; recommendation streams and write actions are blocked by default in low-risk mode
- `boss --platform zhilian hr ...` is still intentionally rejected at runtime because recruiter support is not implemented yet
- `boss --platform qiancheng ...` is registered for schema/config identity only and returns `NOT_SUPPORTED` for real workflows

Architecture notes: [docs/platform-abstraction.en.md](docs/platform-abstraction.en.md).

## 🤖 Agent Integration

The point of this tool is to let AI Agents help organize job-hunting context without automating sensitive platform actions.

```bash
# Step 1: let the Agent read the tool self-description
boss schema

# Step 2: the Agent chains commands via subprocess + JSON parse
# Example (Python):
import subprocess, json
result = subprocess.run(["boss", "search", "Python", "--city", "北京"],
                        capture_output=True, text=True)
jobs = json.loads(result.stdout)["data"]["items"]
```

**MCP integration** (Claude Desktop / Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "boss-agent": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "boss-agent-cli[mcp]", "boss-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [Agent Quickstart](docs/agent-quickstart.en.md) and [Capability Matrix](docs/capability-matrix.en.md) for the full picture.

## 📚 Commands

`boss schema` currently exposes 34 top-level commands, plus 9 first-level recruiter subcommands under `hr`, grouped below by workflow:

| Stage | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| **Auth** | `login` · `logout` · `status` · `doctor` |
| **Discover** | `search` · `detail` · `show` · `cities` · `history` |
| **Restricted Actions** | `greet` · `batch-greet` · `apply` · `exchange` · `mark` are blocked by default |
| **Restricted Track** | `chat` · `chatmsg` · `chat-summary` · `pipeline` · `follow-up` · `digest` are blocked by default; `chatmsg --raw` preserves structured body/link/card fields only after compliance allows the command; use `stats` for local state |
| **Organize** | `watch` · `preset` · `shortlist` |
| **Resume** | `resume` · `me` |
| **AI** | `ai config` · `ai analyze-jd` · `ai polish` · `ai optimize` · `ai suggest` · `ai reply` · `ai interview-prep` · `ai chat-coach` |
| **Utility** | `schema` · `export` · `config` · `clean` |
| **Recruiter** | `hr jobs list/offline/online`; candidate-data and messaging workflows are blocked by default |

Run `boss <cmd> --help` for options, or `boss schema` for the complete JSON self-description.

Search and export can reuse filters selected manually on the BOSS web UI:

```bash
boss search --url 'https://www.zhipin.com/web/geek/jobs?query=Golang&city=101280100&experience=104,105'
boss export --url 'https://www.zhipin.com/web/geek/jobs?query=Golang&city=101280100' --count 50 -o jobs.csv
```

Parameter mode also supports comma-separated multi-select filters such as `--experience "应届,3-5年"` and `--education "本科,硕士"`.

**Export for any agent framework** — no MCP required:

```bash
boss schema --format openai-tools      # OpenAI Functions / Tools API
boss schema --format anthropic-tools   # Claude Tool Use API
```

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

If something misbehaves, always start with:

```bash
boss doctor
boss status
# Optional: run an explicit low-frequency read-only live probe
boss status --live
boss doctor --live-probe
```

<details>
<summary>📖 Common diagnostic checks</summary>

| Check | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| `python_version` | Python ≥ 3.10 installed |
| `patchright_chromium` | Chromium installed |
| `cookie_extract` | Local browser cookies accessible |
| `credential_file` | Encrypted credential file exists and is readable |
| `auth_session` | Encrypted session file readable |
| `cookie_presence` / `wt2_presence` | Cookies and the primary auth cookie are present |
| `stoken_presence` / `stoken_freshness` | `__zp_stoken__` exists and is likely fresh |
| `auth_token_quality` | Core tokens (wt2 / stoken) present |
| `cookie_completeness` | Auxiliary tokens (wbg / zp_at) |
| `cdp` | Chrome DevTools Protocol reachable |
| `bridge_daemon` | Local Browser Bridge daemon is reachable |
| `bridge_extension` | Chrome extension is connected to the daemon |
| `bridge_protocol` | CLI and extension version/protocol are compatible |
| `bridge_workspace` | Current Bridge workspace/tab is usable |
| `bridge_exec` / `bridge_fetch` / `bridge_navigate` | Basic extension execution, browser fetch, and navigation capabilities |
| `browser_channel` | CDP/Bridge summary; not a risk-control bypass path |
| `candidate_search_health` / `candidate_detail_health` | Candidate read-only prerequisites |

</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 Login issues</summary>

For Cookie, CDP, patchright, real-account, request-rate, or platform-drift issues, read [Platform Risk Boundaries](docs/platform-risk.en.md) first.

### Cookie extraction fails

```bash
# Force re-login via QR scan
boss logout && boss login
```

### BOSS detects automation (code 36 / `ACCOUNT_RISK`)

Stop automated access and return to the official BOSS Zhipin website. Do not retry the blocked action through CDP, patchright, or Browser Bridge.

### Browser Bridge is not connected

```bash
python -m boss_agent_cli.bridge.daemon --serve
# Then load and enable extension/ from chrome://extensions, and run:
boss doctor
```

`bridge_daemon`, `bridge_extension`, `bridge_protocol`, `bridge_workspace`,
`bridge_exec`, `bridge_fetch`, and `bridge_navigate` show the local daemon,
extension, tab, and basic browser-command health. Bridge is only for local diagnostics,
user-triggered login compatibility, and read-only assistance. Do not use it to
retry platform risk-control blocks.

### Token expired mid-session

```bash
# stoken (core session token) expires after ~24h
# Re-login or use Chrome CDP hydration; auth_token_quality will report the issue
boss logout && boss login
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 Browser / patchright issues</summary>

### `patchright install chromium` fails

```bash
# macOS / Linux: ensure write access to ~/Library/Caches (macOS) or ~/.cache (Linux)
# Windows: run as admin once
pip install --upgrade patchright
patchright install chromium --with-deps
```

### Chromium launches but stays blank

- Check `auth_session` via `boss doctor` — if "corrupted", delete `~/.boss-agent/auth/` and re-login
- Check `network` — some regions need a proxy: `HTTPS_PROXY=http://...:port boss login`

### CDP connection refused

```bash
# Verify CDP is actually listening
curl http://localhost:9222/json/version

# If empty, Chrome wasn't started with --remote-debugging-port
# macOS users: make sure Chrome is fully quit first (⌘Q, not just close window)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 Search / API errors</summary>

### `code 36` / `ACCOUNT_RISK`

Risk control detected automation. Stop the automated flow and use the official website manually.

### `RATE_LIMITED`

Too many requests in a window. Increase delay:

```bash
boss --delay 3-7 search "python"
# Or set globally
boss config set request_delay "[3.0, 7.0]"
```

### `JOB_NOT_FOUND`

- Check if job was taken down on BOSS website manually
- Pass `--job-id` directly if you have `encrypt_job_id`, skips broken detail cache

### Empty search results despite valid query

- Always check `boss doctor` first — often an auth problem surfacing as zero results
- Add `--log-level debug` to see the actual request going out on stderr

</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 Error codes & agent-friendly recovery</summary>

Every error response contains `code`, `recoverable`, and `recovery_action`, so agents can react programmatically.

| Error Code | Meaning | Agent Recovery |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | Not logged in | `boss login` |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED` | Session expired | `boss login` |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests | Wait and retry |
| `TOKEN_REFRESH_FAILED` | stoken refresh failed | `boss login` |
| `ACCOUNT_RISK` | Risk-control block (code 36) | Stop automated access; use the official website manually |
| `COMPLIANCE_BLOCKED` | Low-risk mode blocked a sensitive command | Use read-only/local tools or complete the action manually on the official website |
| `JOB_NOT_FOUND` | Job removed or invalid | Skip |
| `ALREADY_GREETED` | Already messaged recruiter | Skip |
| `ALREADY_APPLIED` | Already applied | Skip |
| `GREET_LIMIT` | Daily greet quota hit | Pause until tomorrow |
| `NETWORK_ERROR` | Connection failed | Retry with backoff |
| `INVALID_PARAM` | Bad argument | Fix parameter |
| `AI_NOT_CONFIGURED` | AI service not set up | `boss ai config` |
| `AI_API_ERROR` | AI provider call failed | Retry / check key |
| `AI_PARSE_ERROR` | AI response not JSON | Retry |

</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 Glossary (Chinese terms kept in code)</summary>

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `stoken` | Session token — core auth credential for BOSS API |
| `wt2` | Long-lived bearer token, paired with stoken |
| `wbg` / `zp_at` | Auxiliary cookies used by wapi endpoints |
| `security_id` | Per-job opaque ID returned by search; used by detail and local organization commands |
| `encrypt_job_id` | Alternative job ID for the httpx fast path (skips browser) |
| `CDP` | Chrome DevTools Protocol — compatibility login mechanism, not a risk-control bypass |
| `wapi` | BOSS Zhipin internal JSON API (behind `www.zhipin.com/wapi/...`) |

These terms appear in JSON responses and error messages as-is — we deliberately don't translate them to keep parity with BOSS's own naming.

</details>

## 🏗 Architecture

See [中文版 README](README.md#-技术架构) for the full architecture diagram.

Short version: Click CLI → Compliance Guardrails → AuthManager (Fernet-encrypted tokens) → BossClient → JSON envelope on stdout.

Invariant contracts:
- stdout is JSON-only; stderr holds logs (controlled by `--log-level`)
- Error objects always carry `code` + `recoverable` + `recovery_action`
- `boss schema` is the authoritative capability source for Agents

## 🔌 Local Storage

All state lives under `~/.boss-agent/` — encrypted tokens, cached searches, chat history snapshots, resumes, AI config. Nothing leaves your machine except explicit API calls.

## 🤝 Contributing
